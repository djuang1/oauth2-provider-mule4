# MuleSoft - OAuth2 Provider Module Example

The OAuth2 Provider Module allows a Mule Application to be configured as an Authentication Manager in an OAuth2 Dance. With this role, the application will be able to authenticate previously registered clients, grant tokens, validate tokens, or register and delete clients, all during the execution of a flow.

This project provides examples to generate and validate a token and register a client.
